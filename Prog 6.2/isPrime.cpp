/*isPrime Function
A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that is evenly divisible by only 1 and itself.
For example, the number 5 is prime because it can only be evenly divided by 1 and 5.
The number 6, however, is not prime because it can be divided by 1, 2, 3, and 6.
Write a Boolean function named isPrime, which takes an integer as an argument and
returns true if the argument is a prime number, and false otherwise. Demonstrate the
function in a complete program.
TIP: Recall that the % operator divides one number by another, and returns the
remainder of the division. In an expression such as num1 % num2, the % operator will
return 0 if num1 is evenly divisible by num2.
